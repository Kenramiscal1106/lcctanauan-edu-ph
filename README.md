Welcome to the lcctanauan repository, this repository contains the newly proposed lcctanauan site, that will replace the old wordpress one.
## Project Structure âš™

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€public/
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-Bold.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€favicon.ico
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-BoldItalic.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-Light.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-LightItalic.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-Medium.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-MediumItalic.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-Regular.ttf
|    â”œâ”€â”€Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
|    â””â”€â”€Poppins-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
â””â”€â”€src/
    â”œâ”€â”€assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€components/
    |  â”œâ”€â”€Btn.astro
    |  â”œâ”€â”€Card.astro
    |  â”œâ”€â”€Footer.astro
    |  â”œâ”€â”€Navbar.astro
    |  â””â”€â”€NavItem.astro
    â”œâ”€â”€layouts/
    |  â””â”€â”€Default.astro
    â”œâ”€â”€pages/
    |  â””â”€â”€index.astro
    â””â”€â”€styles/
        â””â”€â”€globals.css

```
Astro uses the file routing structure and looks for the `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components. In this project, you can basically use whatever framework you want as long as it doesn't really don't go complicated.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
